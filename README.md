# LinkedIn-Job-Postings-2023
Data Source
For this achievement I chose LinkedIn Job Postings â€“ 2023 data set acquired from Kaggle. This data set is an external open source.
The dataset is sourced from LinkedIn, a widely
utilized professional networking platform connecting companies and individuals in the
pursuit of talent.
The trustworthiness of the dataset depends on various factors, including
the methods used for data collection and the integrity of the source, in this case, LinkedIn.
LinkedIn is a reputable professional networking platform, and if the data was collected
ethically and in accordance with LinkedIn's terms of service, it can be considered
trustworthy.
I have selected this dataset as it meets all the requirements, and I find the topic interesting
for analysis, especially considering that I am in a job search process.
Data Profile
Data collection and contents.
The dataset containing a comprehensive record of 33,000+ job postings on LinkedIn over
the course of 2 days, months apart, was likely collected through a web scraping or data
extraction process. Web scraping involves automated extraction of information from
websites, and in this case, it seems that data was gathered from LinkedIn job postings and
related pages.
